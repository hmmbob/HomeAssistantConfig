This repo contains my Home Assistant configuration. Home Assistant is open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. More information can be found at their website, https://www.home-assistant.io.

I started with Home Assistant back in 2018 somewhere, running it in a [Python venv](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation) directly at a Raspbian installation. I ran into all kind of compatibility issues in the long run, so I decided to switch to a [Docker based setup](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation) in July 2019. Ever since starting with my home automation project, I've been making changes weekly and sometimes daily. However, I don't always commit directly to Github (sorry...) so changes may flow in a bit slower. In April 2020 I completely rebuild my Lovelace setup, and summer 2024 brought a complete new UI setup.

# My Home Automation Vision

My vision is that my Home Automation should always work, even when the internet is down and always should have a manual backup. The house should still be fully functional for me, the others living with me but also my non-tech grandma. That results into choosing solutions that don't use cloud services if not necesarry and that all lights still can always be switched manually.
