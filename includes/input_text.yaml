# I am using this workarond to hide sensor-IDs needed in the rest_command
# payloads. These templates cannot handle secrets, but you can set these
# input_text items with !secret, so in this way the IDs are obfuscated.
# I don't mind having these in my HA instance, I just don't want them on
# GitHub to prevent copy-paste errors.
