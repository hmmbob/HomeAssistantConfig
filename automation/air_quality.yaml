# Sensor uses a NodeMCUv2 and SDS011+BME280 sensors. NodeMCU is flashed with ESPHome
# software. SDS011 updates every 30 mins, the BME280 every 5 minutes. As all BME280
# sensors update at the same time, we only need to monitor one sensor to trigger
# the automation. # Temperature is the sensor that changes most often.
